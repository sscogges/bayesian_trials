Classic one-sample problem: estimate mean and variance of a population

--

Let's be really boring and say we want to estimate the average height of a group of people

--

We program both robots to "know" that Height has some distribution with a finite mean $E[Height] = \mu$ and finite variance $Var[Height] = \sigma^2$




---
class: inverse
--
Let's start with Freq Bot

--

.pull-right[![](figures/robot2_sup.svg)]

--

Freq Bot "knows" that

--

- Height has some finite mean $\mu$

--

- Height has some finite variance $\sigma^2$

--

- ...and that's it!

--

So what's it thinking before it sees any data?

Now let's see what's going on with Bayes Bot

--

.pull-right[![](figures/robot1_yo.svg)]

--

Bayes Bot "knows" everything that Freq Bot knows

--

- Height has some finite mean $\mu$

--

- Height has some finite variance $\sigma^2$

--

...plus some extra stuff about $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ that Freq Bot doesn't.

--

How do we "program" that extra knowledge about $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ into Bayes Bot? 

--

We want Bayes Bot to have an opinion about what it might see...
--
but also be able to change that opinion!

--

We encode that extra knowledge in the form of a probability distribution called the prior distribution

Before seeing any data,

--

- Freq Bot is ready for anything (really, anything)

--

- Bayes Bot has some opinions, but is keeping an open mind

--

We're almost ready to give both of these bots some data
--

But first, they both need to be equipped with additional tools in order to do *statistical inference*

--

Freq Bot will almost always get something based on asymptotics like a Central Limit Theorem,

--

![:scale 50%](figures/clt.svg)

--

while Bayes Bot will get a likelihood (or data model),

--

![:scale 50%](figures/likelihood.svg)

The data look like

```{r}

loadd(heights)

```
`r heights`
